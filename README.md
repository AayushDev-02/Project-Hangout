# Project-Hangout

Idea Behind Project :
Project Hangout is an app that lets you host live audio only conversations with a group of people, while other  users can join and listen in. The topics can range from  tech to sports, business, sales and marketing, literature,  parenting, and so on. 
This is a front end project based on the ui/ux design of a learning based platform website.
You can also randomly host your own space and people turn up magically and the interactions may last for hours. 
Project Hangout lets you interact with people all around.the worldfrom different communities and clubs, share your own thoughts with just a click of a button. 
One of the best feature of HanÊOut is that anyone can host their own room, public or private, makinÊ the app suitable for an intimate chat with a few friends or for public debate.
