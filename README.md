# Project-Hangout
Project Hangout is an app that lets you host live audio only conversations with a group of people, while other  users can join and listen in. The topics can range from  tech to sports, business, sales and marketing, literature,  parenting, and so on. This is a front end project based on the ui/ux design of a learning based platform website.
